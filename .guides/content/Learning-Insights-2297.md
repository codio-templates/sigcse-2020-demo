  The Learning Insights dashboards help instructors to see beyond the grades. Did a student get a good grade while spending a minimal amount of time on the assignment? Did another student put forth a lot of time and effort for a bad grade? These and other metrics help instructors verify that their students remain in the zone of proximal development. Find out which students are in need of additional resources or a harder challenge. See the Codio <a href="https://www.codio.com/blog/codio-advanced-student-learning-insights">blog</a> for more information on our Learning Insights.
