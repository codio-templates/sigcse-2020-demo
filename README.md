# SIGCSE 2020 Demo

## Launching the Demo
The Learning Insights section will only work with the **psenior1** account. So anybody using this demo must be logged in as this user.
* Go to Zed and log in with your GitHub credentials
* Click on "Accounts"
* Search for "psenior1" under "Username"
* Click on the "psenior1" account
* Login as incognito

#### First Time Using the Demo
* Go to the Starter Pack section
* Click on the starter pack called **SIGCSE 2020 Demo**
* Click on the blue button that says "Use Pack"
* Add your name to the starter pack
  * **Patrick SIGCSE 2020 Demo**
  * This will help you find your demo on days two and three

#### All Other Times Using the Demo
* Go to the Projects section
* Under my projects, open the SIGCSE demo with your name on it
* Start the Guide
  * Tools -> Guide -> Play
  * On a Guide page, click the Preview icon (eyeball in the top-right corner)
* Go to the first page - the icon with three horizontal lines (top-right corner) will open the table of contents

## Purpose
This demo is designed to be used by anybody at Codio to show off the platform. The contents of this demo coincides with the information highlighted on the backdrop for our booth. It is a six-page interactive demo, with the last page showing off our custom resources as well having some tools for taking the prospective client further (start a trial, capture information for HubSpot, and a link for more demos).

## Assessments Library
* The gif shows how the the assessments library can be searched.
* Instructors can search by:
  * Programming Language
  * Category - Higher level of organization like loops
  * Content - More specific level of organization while loops and for loops
  * Learning Objective - Always starts with SWBAT (students will be able to) followed by a short description of what the student is expected to know
  * Bloom's Taxonomy - Denotes the complexity and specificity of the problem
* Schools can build their own assessments library
  * This library is private to the institution (other Codio clients won't see the questions) and can be shared with colleagues
  * Institutions can create their own tagging system if they want (class title)

## Code Visualizer
* Students can step through their code one line at a time
  * This makes more abstract concepts like loops, constructors, function/method calls, and recursion more tangible
* The code in the visualizer encrypts our slogan for SIGCSE
* Drag the middle "bar" of the visualizer so all of the code can be seen
* Click the **Next** button to step through the program
  * 1st click - Declare the variable `palin_text`
  * 2nd click - Declare the variable `key`
  * 3rd click - Declare the variable `mode`
  * 4th click - Declare the variable `SYMBOLS`
  * 5th click - Declare the variable `encrypted_text`
  * 6th click - Select the first character of `plain_text`
  * 7th click - Find the position of the first character
  * 8th click - Encrypt the first character
  * All remaining clicks will encrypt the remainder of the plain text phrase; no need to go any further
* The dropdown has a gif to represent how the encryption algorithm (Caesar cipher) works
* The code visualizer works with a variety of programming languages (listed on the Guides page)

## Learning Insights
* The goal of the Insights dashboards is to verify that students are in the zone of proximal development (ZPD).
  * ZPD is an area of learning in which students acquire knowledge through guidance
  * Students "below" the ZPD need additional/different types of guidance
  * Students "above" the ZPD need a greater challenge
* There are four different dashboards (or views), each one is contained in its own dropdown
* The dashboards go from largest scope down to the smallest scope

#### Class Insights
* Show progress for all students across all modules
* There's nothing to click on, opens to the correct dashboard

#### Module Insights
* Show progress for all students for a particular module
* Modules contain several units
* Scroll down to the "Coding with Python" module
* Click "Show Insights"

#### Unit Insights
* Show progress for all students for a particular unit
* Units contain several assignments
* Opens to the proper dashboard, stay on the "Bubble Sort" unit

#### Student Insights
* Show progress for a particular student across the entire class
* Click on a student (the first one is fine)
* Click on "Insights" to see the dashboard

## Auto-Graded Assessments
* All of the auto-graded assessments (except for standard code test) are interactive; be sure to show off what happens when an answer is submitted
* All auto-graded assessments can provide rich, immediate feedback to students (see the information in green after submitting your answer)
* All auto-graded assessments (even code tests) will go into the learning insights dashboards
* Want to emphasize the standard code test and the Parsons problems

#### Standard Code Test
* Gif, not interactive
* No scripting is involved for these code tests
* Checks the result of student code against an expected output
* When the answer is wrong, you will see the expected answer for all three tests
* Student code is fixed, and all three code tests pass
* Rich and immediate feedback is provided (including a solution)

#### Parsons Problem
* Allows students to focus on higher level concepts/ideas and not syntax
* Interactive, drag the correct code blocks into the box below
  * Code blocks must be in the correct order
  * Code blocks must be indented (if necessary)
  * "Distractor" blocks are incorrect and should not be used in the solution
  * Correct response is:
  ```python
  if my_var == 1:
    print("my_var is equal to 1")
  elif my_var == 2:
    print("my_var is equal to 2")
  else:
    print("my_var is greater than 2")
  ```
  * Rich and immediate feedback is provided (including a solution)
  
#### Multiple Choice Questions
* Must have at least two possible choices
* Can have multiple correct answers
* Correct response is:
```
Java
C++
```
* Rich and immediate feedback is provided (including a solution)
  
#### Fill in the Blank (Typing)
* Students have to type the correct answer
* Write the text normally
* Mark up text with `<<<` and `>>>` surrounding the words that will become blanks
* Correct response is:
```
boolean
integer
float
string
```
* Rich and immediate feedback is provided (including a solution)

#### Fill in the Blank (Dropdown)
* Same as the fill in the blank above except that students are presented a dropdown menu with all possible choices
* This method will prevent spelling or capitalization mistakes from marking the question wrong
* There is a toggle switch under the `Grading` section to show possible values
* Correct response is:
```
boolean
integer
float
string
```
* Rich and immediate feedback is provided (including a solution)

## Stacks Library
* Stacks are software configurations for projects
  * Typically the programming language and associated libraries
* Interactive, actual web page
  * Any links and buttons are clickable
  * There is no back button for the stacks page
  * Refresh the browser to reset the stacks page
  * Stay on the certified stacks
    * Certified stacks are made/maintained by Codio
    * My Stacks are custom stacks made by the user (public or private)
    * All public stacks made by all Codio users
  * Use the search box to filter the stacks
    * Search for languages like Python, Java, C++, Node, etc.
    * Click the **X** in the search box to reset the stacks list
* Instructors can make their own custom stacks
  * Custom stacks can be shared or private
* Starter Packs (stack plus files) are another way to create a template
    

## Going Further
* Shows off the content that Codio has created
  * Like stacks, this is a live page
  * Filter the content
  * Click **Read More** to get more details about a particular topic
  * There is no back button, must refresh the screen to rest the resources page (click the button, Command + R on Mac, F5 key on Windows)
* HubSpot widget helps to keep track of people we talk to at the conference
  * All of this information will get saved to HubSpot for later use
  * Ask the person to fill out everything but the "Notes" section
  * Be thorough with the "Notes" section, we'll never remember the conversation by the time we return to Boston
* Link to start a trial if somebody wants one
* Hello Codio is a link for a more detailed demo (more for the content team)
